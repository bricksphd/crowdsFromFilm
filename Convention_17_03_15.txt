Type: Convention

Camera Angle: 45

Observations:
- Age may negatively affect speed (0:20 to 0:44)
- Groups of conversing pedestrians tend to circle (0:09)
- Idle/conversing individuals/groups are generally treated as obstacles, and pedestrians tend to path around them rather than through them
- Intent may affect speed (e.g. meandering/wandering may be slower, while an urgent matter may be quicker)
- Pedestrians may become temporarily attracted to an event/entity apart from their original goal (0:32 to 0:38)
- Pedestrians tend to walk (loosely) on their right side of a given path, unless there are few or no other pedestrians
- Pedestrians may engage an event/entity at a distance (0:51 to 1:07)
