Type: Concert

Camera Angle: 45

Observations:
- "Streams" tend to form in large, condensed crowds (0:00 to 0:20)
- Pairs of pedestrians tend to walk very close in proximity (arms-length or closer)
- Speed of movement appears to be constrained by the environment (slow down based on available space, speed of person in front, etc.)
- Pedestrians not involved in the event, but pathing around crowd tend to path around the crowd rather than through it
- No apparent pattern to individual movement, seemingly random except for the general direction
- Groups that are not actively moving (idling, conversing, etc.) tend to face the direction of the event
- Pedestrians seem to generally path according to established paths or lanes (orange cones from 0:00 to 0:55, pathways in park from 1:00 to 1:16)

Note: potential culture bias, video is filmed in India.
