Type: Public square

Camera Angle: 45

Observations:
- Pairs tend to walk next to each other, within arms-length or closer
- Group of 3 tend to walk in a horizontal line, within arms-length or closer to the members on their right/left
- With groups where members are walking next to each other, some staggering may occur due to variable movement speed, available space, etc.
- Conversing groups tend to form circles
- Pedestrians (in this video) appear to prefer a left-hand conflict resolution
	- Meaning when heading for another pedestrian, they favor the left-side over the right; potential culture bias? filmed in Croatia
