Type: Cross walk

Camera Angle: 45

Observations: 
- Pedestrians generally stay on the right side of path
  - (12 out of 14 [to far side])
  - (31 out of 52 [to near side])
  - (11 out of 16 [toward top side of bus])
  - (29 out of 30 [away from top side of bus])
  - (3 out of 6 [toward top of screen below bus])
  - Begins to fall apart when there are no oncoming pedestrians
- Groups of two tend to generally walk next to each other
- Individuals generally maintain arms-length or further distance from one another unless space, speed, or path intersection prevent it
- Pedestrians' actual pathing is loosely related to the provided paths
	- Pedestrians will often take a path somewhere between the most "defined" path and the "crow's" path
- Pedestrians seem to be generally non-confrontational, slowing down for others that cross their paths to avoid collision
	- At the same time, some pedestrians show a degree of carelessness for their fellow pedestrians
