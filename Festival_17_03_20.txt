Type: Festival

Camera Angle: 45

Observations:
[0:45 to 0:52]
	- Groups tend to walk in close proximity (arms-length or closer) and in a horizontal line
	- Space between groups and individuals within groups may vary, possibly due to available space
[0:52 to 1:22]
	- Idlers (non-pathing pedestrians) may prioritize shade (outdoors)
	- Pathing seems generally random (just in a general direction)
	- No set walkways/the whole terrain is a walkway
	- Conversing groups tend to form circles
[1:25 to 1:45]
	- Pedestrians tend to respect boundaries and crowds generally conform to them
		- In the same way, in the absence of boundaries, pedestrians seem to semi-randomly disperse
	- Streams of pedestrians seem to form in large crowds
[1:55 to 2:34]
	- Pedestrians may prefer established paths to weaving through crowds (maybe until crowd density is less?)
		- In the same way, pedestrians may abandon established paths to weave through crowds (maybe once crowd density is lower, pathing is easier?)
	- Pedestrians in "streams" tend to play "follow-the-leader", where if one pedestrian in the stream shifts the path, the rest will follow
