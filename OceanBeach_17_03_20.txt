Type: Ocean beach

Camera Angle: 45, Top-down

Observations:
- Pedestrians are much more spread out (except for groups, which tend to maintain arms-length or closer distance to one another)
	- Maybe a relationship between available space and the space between people/groups?
	- Higher density on beach, lower density on water (less space on beach, more in water; same space-to-density relationship?)
	- Varying land/water area desirability?
- Pairs walk within arms-length distance or closer
- Loose, temporary lanes may form when there is pedestrian traffic going both directions
