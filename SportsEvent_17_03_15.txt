Type: Sports event

Camera Angle: Top down

Observations:
- Groups tend to walk either next to each other (with slight vertical variance) or behind one another (when path is narrow)
- Groups of conversing/idling pedestrians tend to form circles
- Some pedestrians walk on their right side of the path, while others walk on their left side of the path (footage is of USA vs. Ireland polo, maybe cultural influence?)
