Type: Flash mob

Camera Angle: Eye level or very shallow

Observations:

- As pedestrian crowds grow larger, movement in general appears increasingly random/without pattern
	- Pedestrians will also weave through the crowd more, moving to open spots
- "Streams" (lines of pedestrians moving through a thick, generally stationary crowd) sometimes form
- Conversing groups may form circles
- Groups tend to move in close proximity to one another (many 2-person groups walk touching or nearly touching)
- In larger groups/areas, "lane" formation may fall apart without clear guidance
- Pedestrians moving faster seem to move around slower moving pedestrians, sometimes at very close proximity
