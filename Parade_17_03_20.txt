Type: Parade

Camera Angle: 45, Top-down

Observations:
- Viewing pedestrians appear to prioritize line-of-sight
- Idling pedestrians appear to generally keep established paths clear
- Groups tend to walk in horizontal lines, sometimes with slight vertical staggering, maintaining arms-length or closer distance from one another
- Pedestrians generally respect established barriers (variable barrier "strength"? i.e. police barrier vs arm railing)
- Density of idling pedestrians appears to be where proximity to event and line-of-sight are greatest
- Pedestrians appear to generally maintain right-hand lanes, at least on established paths
